## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-local/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    ansible_remote_tmp: /tmp/ansible

  roles:
    - role: buluma.local
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-local/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false

  roles:
```
